# Code Snippet Directory

This is my directory for code snippets I can refer to. Please ignore comments 
in files. I placed them there to remind me of things I feel are important at the
time. If for whatever reason, there is someone who doesn't know rust but you are
interested in learning in order, just follow the directory in order. Compare to 
whatever language you know.
